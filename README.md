DYNASYS (A Dynamical System Solver)

The software is developed to exemplify dynamical systems like

    ODEs: Lorenz system, Rossler system, Lotka-Volterra Predator-Prey model
    DDEs: Mackey-Glass System, Equivalent Mackey-Glass System invented by us, Half-wave nonlinear Time-Delay system (Last two have been invented by us)
    Maps: Logistic Map.

It will work on python 2.7

This is software to intrgrate ODEs, DDEs and Maps developed by Dr. Debabrata Biswas (debbisrs@gmail.com) with the kind and useful suggestions of Dr. Tanmoy Banerjee
To run the software

extract the "dynasys_0.2.tar.gz" in the home directory and then

python dynasys.py
System Requirement:

python, python-numpy, matplotlib, Tkinter, pydelay
